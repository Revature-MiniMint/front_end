# The_Java_Stuff = backend
# The_React_Stuff = frontend

* Step 1: Clone the repo and open The_Java_Stuff in IntelliJ / Eclipse
* Step 2: Configure application.properties with your MySQL credentials and create the database (default name=revature).
* Step 3: Open the "test" folder and run all 3 test methods
(if populatePresets() doesn't work, navigate to localhost:10011/presets to manually trigger it).
* Step 4: Open the "services" folder and hardcode the accessKey and secretKey for the AWS s3 server.
(If no access to the private doc, ask Tim/James/Luis for the keys. These cannot be shared anywhere.)
* Step 5: Run the Project3Application main method to start the Spring Boot server
* Step 6: Open The_React_Stuff in VSCode and run npm install and npm start in the terminal

Have fun! :)
